### **How to use NPCLib in your project**
<details> <summary>üë§ Step 1: Create an NPC</summary>

**Option A ‚Äì Use a Marker Point**
You can either create an `MarkerPoint` `GameObject` on your model for the marker to position itself
```cs
GameObject character = GameObject.Instantiate(MyCustomNPC);
Transform markerPoint = character.transform.Find("MarkerPoint");
NPC npc = new NPC(character, markerPoint, "MyUniqueInteractionName");
```
**Option B ‚Äì Use an offset from the center**
```cs
GameObject character = GameObject.Instantiate(MyCustomNPC);
NPC npc = new NPC(character, new Vector3(0, 5, 0), "MyUniqueInteractionName");
```

</details> <details> <summary>üí¨ Step 2: Add Dialogue</summary>

*Multiple syntax options are supported. Choose what you like:*

**Builder with object initializer**
```cs
using (new DialogBuilder(npc)
{
  { Characters.Captain, "Hello." },
  { Characters.Courier, "Hi!" },
}) { }
```

**Builder with chained Add**
```cs
using (DialogBuilder builder = new DialogBuilder(npc))
{
  builder.Add(Characters.Captain, "Hello.");
  builder.Add(Characters.Courier, "Hi!");
}
```

**Pre-built and committed**
```cs
DialogBuilder dialog = new DialogBuilder(npc);
dialog.Add(Characters.Captain, "Hello.");
dialog.Add(Characters.Courier, "Hi!");
npc.CommitDialog(dialog);
```

**From list**
```cs
List<DialogEntry> dialog = new()
{
  new(Characters.Captain, "Hello."),
  new(Characters.Courier, "Hi!")
};
npc.CommitDialog(dialog);
```

</details> <details> <summary>üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Customize Behavior (Optional)</summary>

```cs
ExtraConfig config = new ExtraConfig
{
  CameraRig = customCameraRig,
  OnCreated = npc => Debug.Log("NPC spawned!"),
  OnComplete = npc => Debug.Log("Dialog done."),
  PersistantOnComplete = true
};
NPC npc = new NPC(character, markerPoint, "InteractionID", config);
```
</details>

### ‚ùì FAQ

#### > What‚Äôs this for?
For modders making custom NPCs in Haste. It saves you from reinventing the ***FUCKING CURSED*** dialog system.

#### > Does it play nice with other mods?
Should work fine. May conflict with similar libraries if ones ever get made lol.

#### > What if I break something?
Open an issue or scream in the [Haste Modding Community](https://discord.gg/hastebrokenworlds).

<!--

This will remain in "beta" for the time being. </br>
Strictly for teasing and contributing till we have a fully working system that meets a few unlisted criteria. </br>

(HOW THE FUCK DID I MANAGE TO WRITE "teasing" INSTEAD OF "testing" WHAT)

Mainly, importing custom characters. </br>
It's not necessarily hard to do, it's just trying to find a way to make it easier for the end-user. </br>

But feel free to mess around with it. Break it. Re-write it. Spit on it. Don't care. Go for gold. </br>
And if you want to use this, give credit where it's due and prepare for any bugs that will occur.
