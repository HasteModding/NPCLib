NPCLib is a library that helps with adding interaction dialogues to your custom NPCs.  

This library contains all the resources you need to make your NPCs come to life, 
whether you're making a witty sage, a quirky merchant, or just a grunt who says "ugh."

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### **What does NPCLib do?**

NPCLib is a modding tool that helps you:
- Give your custom NPCs interaction dialogs.
- Handle NPC interactions, behaviors, character sprites, vocal banks, and dialogue sequences with ease.
- Patch Haste's `InteractableCharacter` class to make it work with your custom NPCs.

---
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### **Features**

- **Dialog System**:  
  Use the `DialogBuilder` to create and oversee dialog sequences with an easy-to-use syntax.

- **Custom Characters**:  
  Define your NPCs using the `Characters` enum, and then let NPCLib take care of the rest, including vocal banks and sprites.

- **Interaction System**:  
  With a few lines of code, you can give your NPCs unique camera setups using the `InteractionCameraRig` class.

- **IL Patching**:  
  NPCLib patches the `InteractableCharacter` class, allowing you to concentrate on your mod without worrying about breaking anything.

### **How to use NPCLib in your project**

#### Step 1: Create an NPC

You can either create an `MarkerPoint` `GameObject` on your model for the marker to position itself
```cs
GameObject character = GameObject.Instantiate(MyCustomNPC);
Transform markerPoint = character.transform.Find("MarkerPoint");
NPC npc = new NPC(character, markerPoint, "MyUniqueInteractionName");
```
Or create an offset from the models center position. In this case, 5 units above the model.
```cs
GameObject character = GameObject.Instantiate(MyCustomNPC);
NPC npc = new NPC(character, new Vector3(0, 5, 0), "MyUniqueInteractionName");
```

---
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

#### Step 2: Add Dialog

There are multiple ways of creating dialog for your NPC.
```cs
NPC npc = ...; // Your NPC instance
using (new DialogBuilder(npc)
{
  { Characters.Captain, "Hello." },
  { Characters.Courier, "Hi!" },
}) { }
```
```cs
NPC npc = ...; // Your NPC instance
using (DialogBuilder builder = new DialogBuilder(npc))
{
  builder.Add(Characters.Captain, "Welcome to the ship!");
  builder.Add(Characters.Courier, "I have a message for you.");
}
```
```cs
NPC npc = ...; // Your NPC instance
DialogBuilder dialog = new DialogBuilder(npc);
dialog.Add(Characters.Captain, "Hello.");
dialog.Add(Characters.Courier, "Hi!");
npc.CommitDialog(dialog);
```
```cs
NPC npc = ...; // Your NPC instance
List<DialogEntry> dialog = new List<DialogEntry>()
{
  new(Characters.Captain, "Hello."),
  new(Characters.Courier, "Hi!")
};
npc.CommitDialog(dialog);
```

> [!TIP]
> You can choose whichever approach works the best for you and your needs.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

#### Step 3: Customize Behavior (Optional)

Want to tweak how your NPC behaves? Use the `ExtraConfig` struct to add custom camera rigs or actions:
```cs
ExtraConfig config = new ExtraConfig
{
  cameraRig = customCameraRig,
  onComplete = npc => Debug.Log("Dialog finished!"),
  onCreated = npc => Debug.Log("NPC created!")
};
NPC npc = new NPC(character, markerPoint, "CustomInteraction", config);
```

### **FAQ**

#### **What is this for?**
NPCLib is for modders of **Haste** who want to add interaction dialogs to their custom NPCs.</br>
If you're making a mod with NPCs, this is for you... Seriously just use this rather than messing around yourself üò≠

#### **Does it work with other mods?**
Most likely. This may cause issues with other similar libraries, but there are none for now.

#### **What if I break something?**
No worries! Open an issue or tell me in the [Haste Modding Community](https://discord.gg/hastebrokenworlds) server.

This will remain in "beta" for the time being. </br>
Strictly for teasing and contributing till we have a fully working system that meets a few unlisted criteria. </br>

(HOW THE FUCK DID I MANAGE TO WRITE "teasing" INSTEAD OF "testing" WHAT)

Mainly, importing custom characters. </br>
It's not necessarily hard to do, it's just trying to find a way to make it easier for the end-user. </br>

But feel free to mess around with it. Break it. Re-write it. Spit on it. Don't care. Go for gold. </br>
And if you want to use this, give credit where it's due and prepare for any bugs that will occur.
