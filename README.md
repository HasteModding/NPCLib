This will remain in "beta" for the time being. </br>
Strictly for teasing and contributing till we have a fully working system that meets a few unlisted criteria. </br>

Mainly, importing custom characters. </br>
It's not necessarily hard to do, it's just trying to find a way to make it easier for the end-user. </br>

But feel free to mess around with it. Break it. Re-write it. Spit on it. Don't care. Go for gold. </br>
And if you want to use this, give credit where it's due and prepare for any bugs that will occur.
